# Get Involved
Hey, you! Thanks for coming to this project. There are a lot of ways you can contribute to this.

Some ideas:
1. Collect Veda mantras in original Devanagari text with Vedic accent marks -- either manually or creating scripts
2. Error corrections (mantras from many sources have issues -- if you have access to various gurujis, you can get it checked and fix the source)
3. Generate images using GANs (or other Deep learning tools) of Vedic gods and rituals based on text descriptions in the Vedas
4. Help translations (do it direct only if you have experience with Vedic Sanskrit) by collecting copyright expired content from various ancient sages --such as those of Adi Shankara and Madhwacharya.
5. Help improve the website and themes
6. Give feedback
7. Spread the word around

And more...
