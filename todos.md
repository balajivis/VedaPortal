# Todos
This is the Todo for the high level project. For each sub-project we could have similar organisation.

1. Create Github [pages](https://pages.github.com/) to browse through the project: 
2. Choose a nice theme from [here](https://jekyllthemes.io/free): 
3. Explore [AI generated images](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?search=Divya+Chitram&title=Special:MediaSearch&go=Go&type=image) of Vedic gods to potentially add it to this.
